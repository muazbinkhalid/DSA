# 🌳 Binary Tree Implementations in C++

## 📋 Description

This project contains two exercises demonstrating two different implementations of a **Binary Tree** in C++:

- **Exercise 8.1** – Binary Tree using an **Array-based** structure.
- **Exercise 8.2** – Binary Tree using a **Pointer-based** (dynamic) structure.

Each version supports node insertion and all standard tree traversals:
- **Inorder**
- **Preorder**
- **Postorder**

---

## 📁 File Structure

- `main.cpp`  
  Contains both exercises (commented sections) for easy switching and testing.
