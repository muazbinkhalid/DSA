#  Lab Task 1: Object-Oriented Programming in C++

## üìù Description  
This lab task focuses on implementing various C++ concepts, including operator overloading, templates, file handling, and object-oriented programming. 
---



Example 1.1: Function Overloading  
- Demonstrates different methods for finding the maximum of two integers using normal functions and pass-by-reference techniques.
Example 1.2: Complex Number Operations  
- A Complex class is defined to represent complex numbers.  
- Operations such as addition and assignment (=) are overloaded.

Exercise 1.1: Complex Number Multiplication  
- A Complex class is defined for complex number multiplication using operator overloading.

Example 1.3: Template Functions  
- A template function GetMax() is implemented to find the maximum of two values of different types.

Example 1.4: Template Class (Maximum Value)  
- A template class `myPair` is defined to return the maximum of the two values.

Example 1.4 (Modified): Template Class (Minimum Value)  
- The template class `myPair` is extended to find the minimum of two values.

Example 1.5: Template Class with Fixed Array Size  
- A template class `mySequence` is defined to store and access elements in a fixed-size block of memory.

Exercise 1.3: Template Class with Min/Max Functions  
- Extends the template class `mySequence` to find the minimum and maximum values in an array.

Example 1.6: File Handling (Character Count)  
- Demonstrates reading from one file, writing to another, and counting characters.
Exercise 1.4: File Handling (Word and Sentence Count)  
- Reads a text file and counts the number of words and sentences.

Example 1.7: File Handling with Student Data  
- Reads student marks from a file, calculates the weighted average, and writes detailed information to an output file.

Exercise 1.6: Student Grades Calculation  
- Reads student data and grades from a file.  
- Computes the average grades and displays information in tabular form.  
- Determines the highest and lowest averages.
